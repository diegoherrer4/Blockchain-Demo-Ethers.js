This is a project that I did in order to learn Ethers.js.

It does two simple things:

1. Has the ability to set and display a greeting.
2. It has a payable deposit function that is able to receive funds.

Simplistic front-end with React and Bootstrap.
Solidity used for the contract.
Hardhat for EDE.
